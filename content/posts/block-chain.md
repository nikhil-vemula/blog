List of blocks linked using  cryptograrphy.

SHA256 - hashing algorithm.

5 Requirements for hashing algorithm to be used.

* One-way
* Determistic
* Fast computation
* The Avalanche effect
* Must withstand collisions

## Immutable ledger

## Distributed P2P Network

## Byzantine fault tolerance

## Consensus protocols

* Attackers challenge
* Competing challenge

### Types

Proof of work (PoW)

* They work to find the golden nounce (cryptographic puzzle) to get the fee associated with the transaction
* Every single node does a series of checks on the new block and rejects if found malicious
* If when two valid block from different sources come, then the chain wait for next block. The chain containing the next block is selected.

Proof of stake (PoS)

## Bit coin

Layers:

* Technology
* Protocol
  * How to come
  * Authentication
  * Update to protocol
* Token
